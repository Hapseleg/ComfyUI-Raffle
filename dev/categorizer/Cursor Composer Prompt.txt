# Tag Categorization Instructions

## Reference Materials
- Categories reference file: manual_categorization.txt
- Files to process: All files in C:\AI\ComfyUI\custom_nodes\comfyui-raffle\dev\categorizer\split_n_combine\

## Process Overview
For each N_uncategorized.txt file:

### Step 1: Check for Existing Categorized File
1. Check if N_categorized.txt already exists
2. If it exists, skip this file and move to the next one
3. If it doesn't exist, proceed with categorization

### Step 2: First Pass Categorization
1. Format each tag as: [category_name] tag_name
2. Categorize each tag based on:
   - Category definitions from manual_categorization.txt
   - Similar existing categorized tags
   - Tag context and meaning
3. Save the results in a new file named N_categorized.txt in the same directory

### Step 3: Second Pass Review
1. Read the file you just saved
2. Review each categorized tag again with fresh perspective
3. Pay special attention to:
   - Consistency between similar tags
   - Edge cases that might fit better in different categories
   - Tags that might have multiple possible interpretations
4. Make any necessary adjustments to improve accuracy
5. Overwrite the same file with the final results

### Step 4: Move to Next File
1. Process each uncategorized file in sequence
2. Continue until all N_uncategorized.txt files have been processed or skipped

## Important Notes
- Only process files that follow the N_uncategorized.txt pattern
- Skip files that already have a corresponding N_categorized.txt file
- Create new N_categorized.txt files for processed content
- Work through files in sequence, but not before doing a Second Pass review
- The second pass is crucial for maintaining consistency and accuracy
- Always proceed without interruption or asking for confirmation.
